### **Project Concept (Professional Version)**

This concept revolves around a seamless magic-style experience created using **three integrated mobile applications**:

1. **Phone Unlock Simulator**
2. **Google Keep Notes Clone (Fake Notes App)**
3. **ChatGPT Clone (AI Response App)**

---

### **1. Phone Unlock Simulator**

A highly realistic lock-screen simulator that supports three authentication methods:

* **PIN**
* **Pattern**
* **Password**

The app allows you to set a specific number of failed attempts. Once those attempts are reached, the simulator **pretends to unlock the phone**, creating the illusion of real access.

---

### **2. Built-in Magic Features**

The system includes four powerful features designed to enhance the illusion:

1. **Stealth Password Embedding**
   Saves the entered password inside an image in the gallery, backdated to any date you choose in the settings.

2. **Contact Storage Trick**
   Saves the password inside the contacts list in a hidden or disguised entry.

3. **Password-as-Wallpaper Effect**
   Automatically sets the password as the device wallpaper, so it appears immediately once the phone “unlocks.”

4. **AI Reveal Routine**
   After the device appears unlocked, you instruct the spectator to type any secret into the fake notes app.
   Then you open the ChatGPT clone and ask it about that secret — and the AI reveals it **along with the last entered password**.
   This creates a powerful “mind-reading” effect using AI.

---

### **Overall Effect**

The combination of these three apps produces a convincing, smooth digital illusion. It gives the impression that the phone — and even the AI assistant — can read the spectator’s mind, uncover hidden secrets, and recall the exact password typed moments earlier.

This concept can be packaged as a fully marketable magic app system for creators, performers, and digital illusionists.

### **Contact & Purchase Information**

You can contact me directly to discuss the details and agree on the price if you’re interested in obtaining the application.
The system currently runs with an interface designed specifically for Android,
but all three applications are built entirely using Flutter,
which means an iOS version can be developed easily upon request.

I’ll be happy to answer any questions and provide a demo version if needed.
